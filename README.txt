*** Installation ***
Clone this project in the libraries folder of your default sketch directory. For example, on OSX, the directory would be ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/. On Windows, it would be My Documents\Arduino\libraries\.

The sources folder can be removed, it is useful only if you want to modify the library.

***Development***
You should be able to import the Eclipse project without issues.
For the moment, you need a shell to create the library, which means that you might have to write a DOS script to the behaviour of make.sh if you want to develop from Windows.
